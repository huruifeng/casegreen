                     <p>
                         <b>(1) Who are we ?</b><br>
                         We are a group of immigrants, and experienced the whole processes of several visa applications.
                         We are truly and definitely understanding the worries, anxieties, and uncertain exceptions during the painful, also maybe delightful, journey of preparing forms/documents, submitting applications and waiting for the notices.
                         Here we are leading this project to provide as more information/data/statistics as we could to relieve your anxieties.<br>
                         <u>Immigrants help future immigrants.</u>
                     </p>
                      <p>
                          <b>(2) What are the data sources ?</b><br>
                         The original data are from the USCIS (Websites, Emma, USCIS APIs,et.al.) and also the user corrections. The data is updated daily,usually at early morning.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                         <b> (3) How to read the Receipt Number ?</b><br>
                         The USCIS Receipt notice generated is sent to applicants as ‘Form I-797C, Notice of Action‘.
                         The top of the receipt notice indicates this form number and details.
                         The I-797C form generated has an indication on it that says ‘Notice Type‘ as ‘Receipt Notice‘, which confirms that it is a USCIS Receipt Notice.<br>
                         The Receipt notice also has details about the application or case type, the received date, receipt number, applicant name, and other important information.
                         The applicant or attorney, who files the application with USCIS gets the physical copy of the receipt notice mailed to them.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                          USCIS receipt number that is generated by the USCIS online case management system is based on a set of criteria to indicate where it is being processed, when it was filed, etc.
                          It is a 13-digit number. The receipt number always starts with 3 alphabets like LIN, MSC, EAC, WAC, etc. It is followed by a 10-digit number.<br>
                          Center list:
                         <ul>
                            <li>EAC – Eastern Adjudication Center (now known as Vermont Service Center)</li>
                            <li>IOE – USCIS online account (efile)</li>
